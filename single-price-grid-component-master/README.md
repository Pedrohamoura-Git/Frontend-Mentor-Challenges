## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use the grid property "auto-fit" that automatically adjusts the responsiveness of the site according to the defined "min" and "max" parameters. I also learned to use the "span" in a container to extend it by multiple columns. Lastly, I learned how to use the "box-shadow" property to create the depth effect in the main container.

### Continued development

I am not totally comfortable with CSS Grid and Media Queries yet, so I am going to continue focusing on it in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [HTML/CSS]The order of media queries(https://shuhei-blog.work/uncategorized/order-media-queries/) - This helped me understand better how I should use Media Queries in order to it work properly. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
