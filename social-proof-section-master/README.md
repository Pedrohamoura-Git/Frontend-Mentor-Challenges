## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I've decidded to try the Desktop-First insted of Mobile-First to see which one would be more suitable for me. I think Desktop-Fist needs more lines of code, so I think it's going to be better if I stick to Mobile-First.

### Continued development

I am not totally comfortable with CSS Grid and Media Queries yet, so I am going to continue focusing on it in future projects.
