## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a really good challenge to test my skill in CSS. I had to do some research to learn a little bit more about transitions, different types of selectors and the SVG type of image.
### Continued development

There is a lot of things that I don't know about animations yet, so I'm going to find new challenges to practice it.
