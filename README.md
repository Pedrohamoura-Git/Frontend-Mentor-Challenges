## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great opportunity to implement CSS Grid and Mobile-First approach to a project.

### Continued development

I am totally comfortable with CSS Grid and Media Queries yet, so I am going to continue focusing on it in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [HTML/CSS]The order of media queries(https://shuhei-blog.work/uncategorized/order-media-queries/) - This helped me understand better how I should use Media Queries in order to it work properly. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
